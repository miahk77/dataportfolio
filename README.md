# dataportfolio

This repository contains data analysis and web dev projects stored as notebooks created with Jupyter Notebook.

# [Project 1 : Study App ](https://github.com/miahk77/dataportfolio/blob/main/study_app.ipynb)
- Created a study app using functions and user input.
- The app allows the user to choose between 3 options : add a question, initiate a study session and quit. The first two options are run using a function.
- Add question option : The app prompts the user to manually enter questions, responses, the correct answer, and a list of topic tags. 
- Study session option : The app randomly selects a question from the list of questions, allows the user to input a response and view all possible responses, and then informs the user on whether their answer is correct. 

# [Project 2 : Analysing SAT and ACT Scores - Data Analytics using Pandas](https://github.com/miahk77/dataportfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202%20-%20College%20Board.ipynb)

## Deliverables:
- Cleaned the data with rationale-backed handling of null or missing values.
- Joined the data sets together into a single DataFrame (this was named combinedactsat for reference).
- Correlate participation rates in SAT tests with other data points of your choosing.
