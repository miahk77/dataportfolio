This repository contains data analysis and web dev projects stored as notebooks created with Jupyter Notebook.

#[Project 1 : Study App ](https://github.com/miahk77/dataportfolio/blob/main/study_app.ipynb)
- Created a study app using functions and user input.
- The app allows the user to choose between 3 options : add a question, initiate a study session and quit. The first two options are run using a function.
- Add question option : The app prompts the user to manually enter questions, responses, the correct answer, and a list of topic tags. 
- Study session option : The app randomly selects a question from the list of questions, allows the user to input a response and view all possible responses, and then informs the user on whether their answer is correct.
